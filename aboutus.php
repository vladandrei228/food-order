            I chose to work on this project as the topic of my dissertation for several reasons. Firstly, it was an idea that came in my mind out of nowhere, I was just focused on gaining new skills in the web development area, as I followed an internship in this field, I can say that I fell in love with what magic can be done while using only HTML and CSS which are not even programming language. 
Secondly, as I got the idea, I was asking myself what should I do, how should I start, which programming language should I use. After a few days of overthinking about this questions, and a few meeting with my supervisor, at first I wanted to do it as it is most common done, by using as my programming language JavaScript, I was not as happy as I could be, although I had found an programming language which for sure could have been easier to be used in this project, I prefer to challenge myself and try to use PHP as the programming language.
Last but not least, I chose this topic for my dissertation, because I wanted to make a good work and use it in my portfolio too.
